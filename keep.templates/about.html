		<h2>Our Project</h2>
		<p>We wanted to make a modular application that would help motivate people to complete their goals. keepingUP.Online was created in mind for teams to promote healthy competition.</p>

		<h2>How It Works</h2>
		<p>keepingUP.Online allows you to create tasks called goals. Goals can be run daily or over a week. The application will give periodic reminders about the goal and your current progress. At the end of each day, input your progress, and the system will keep track of it for you. Completing goals gives you points, which are totalled up at the end of the week. The scoreboard lets everyone know how they are doing, along with statistics such as most improved.</p>
